    "1 Explain the key features of Python that make it a popular choice for p$ogramming.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans\n",
    "\n",
    "Because of its following main aspects, Python is so widely adopted for programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "i. Readability and Simplicity : Python has one of the cleanest syntaxes making it an ideal first language to learn in most cases Readability is another, because it means those who wish to write code can do so in a clean and understandable way.\n",
    "\n",
    "ii. General-Purpose: Python is known as a general-purpose language means that it can be used in almost all types of applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "iii. Extensive Standard Library: Python has a broad collection of libraries for many work, allowing you to write little code as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "iv. Rich Ecosystem: Python has n an overwhelming number of third-party libraries, frameworks like Django and Flask for web development, Pandas and NumPy for data analysis &TensorFlow and PyTorch for Machine Learning ylabel etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "v. Multi-platform (Cross-Platform) Support: Python is a multiplatform language and therefore code written in python will be able to execute on various other OS like Window, MacOs & Linux without major modifications.\n",
    "\n",
    "vi. Python Community Support: Python has an extremely large and active community of developers who contribute to its development, create libraries, as well as provide forums for discussion, tutorials and documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "vii. Interpreted Language: Python is a high level language and in the category of interpreted languages. This speed up testing and debugging, which makes development more effective.\n",
    "\n",
    "viii. Compatibility with other Languages and Technologies : Python easily can to combine among other languages such as C, C++, Java etc . However, this would make the program unusable for other scenarios — it locks us into developing programs against a specific type of stream. These types are more generic and were introduced in .NET to allow developers like you as much flexibility as possible when writing out code so that you could experience great leverage on your projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "ix. Multiple Paradigm Support: Python also welcomes and integrates many programming paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented and functional — hence powerful.\n",
    "\n",
    "x. Highly Supportive for Automation and Scripting — You can script stuff in Python very easily, which is essential especially if you have bunch of repetitive tasks that you don't want to sit behind your desktop/endpoints.\n",
    "\n",
    "All of these features together make Python an attractive, powerful language for a variety of programming task."

    "2 Describe the role of predefined keywords in Python and provide examples of how they are used in a program.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans\n",
    "\n",
    "Keywords are reserved words in Python that have special meanings and cannot be used as identifiers (variable names, function names, etc.). \n",
    "Examples of keywords include if, else, while, for, def, class, import, try, except, return, True, False, None, etc.\n",
    "Keywords are case-sensitive and cannot be redefined or overridden within a Python program.\n",

    "3 Compare and contrast mutable and immutable objects in Python with examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans\n",
    "\n",

    "4 Discuss the different types of operators in Python and provide examples of how they are used.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans\n",
    "\n",
    "i. Arithmetic operators : These are used to perform mathematical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, etc. \n",
    "For example,\n",
    "\n",
    "a = 7\n",
    "b = 2\n",
    "\n",
    "print ('Sum: ', a + b)  #\n",

    "print ('Subtraction: ', a - b)   \n",
    "\n",
    "print ('Multiplication: ', a * b)  \n",
    "\n",
    "ii. Comparison operators: these compare two values/variables and return a boolean result: True or False. \n",
    "For example,\n",
    "\n",
    "a = 5\n",
    "b = 2\n",
    "\n",
    "print('a == b =', a == b)\n",
    "\n",
    "print('a != b =', a != b)\n",
    "\n",
    "print('a > b =', a > b)\n",
    "\n",
    "print('a < b =', a < b)\n",
    "\n",
    "iii. Logical operators: These are used to check whether an expression is True or False. They are used in decision-making. \n",
    "For example,\n",
    "\n",
    "print(True and True)     # True\n",
    "print(True and False)    # False\n",
    "print(True or False)     # True\n",
    "print(not True)          # False\n",
    "\n",
    "iv. Assignment operators: These are used to assign values to variables. \n",
    "For example,\n",
    "\n",
    "a = 10\n",
    "b = 5 \n",
    "a += b      \n",
    "print(a)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Output: 15\n",
    "\n",
    "v. Bitwise operators: These operators act on operands as if they were strings of binary digits. They operate bit by bit, hence the name.\n",
    "5 & 3 #1 \n",
    "\n",
    "vi. Identity Operator: These operators are used to compare the memory locations of two objects.\n",
    "For Example\n",
    "\n",
    "x = [1, 2, 3]\n",
    "y = x\n",
    "result = (x is y)  # result is True\n",
    "\n",
    "vii. Membership Operator: These operators are used to test if a sequence contains a value.\n",
    "For Example\n",
    "\n",
    "fruits = [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\"]\n",
    "result = (\"banana\" in fruits)  # result is True\n",

    "5 Explain the concept of type casting in Python with examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans\n",
    "\n",
    "Type casting, also referred to as type conversion, is the process of changing one data type to another in Python. \n",
    "Python provides built-in functions for type casting, such as int(), float(), str(), list(), tuple(), dict(), etc.\n",

    "Types of Type Casting\n",
    "Implicit Type Casting\n",
    "Explicit Type Casting\n",
    "\n",
    "i. Implicit Type Casting\n",
    "Python sometimes converts data types automatically. This usually happens when performing operations with different types.\n",
    "\n",
    "eg:\n",
    "a = 5       # Integer\n",
    "b = 2.5     # Float\n",
    "c = a + b   # Python converts 'a' to a float and adds it to 'b'\n",
    "print(c)    # Output: 7.5\n",
    "\n",
    "ii. Explicit Type Casting\n",
    "You explicitly convert data types using built-in functions like int(), float(), and str().\n",
    "\n",
    "eg:\n",
    "x = \"10\"\n",
    "y = int(x)  # Converts string \"10\" to integer 10\n",
    "print(y)    # Output: 10\n",
    "print(type(y))  # Output: <class 'int'>\n"

    "6 How do conditional statements work in Python? Illustrate with examples\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans\n",
    "\n",
    "Conditionals in Python are used to execute code based on the evaluation of one or more conditions.\n",
    "Python supports conditional statements such as if, elif (else if), and else to control the flow of execution.\n",
    "Conditionals can be nested to handle multiple conditions and control different branches of execution based on the outcome of logical expressions.\n",
    "\n",
    "i. if Statement: Checks if a condition is true. If it is, the code block inside the if statement is executed.\n",
    "eg:\n",
    "age = 18\n",
    "if age >= 18:\n",
    "    print(\"You are an adult.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "ii. elif Statement: Short for \"else if,\" it checks another condition if the previous if or elif conditions are false.\n",
    "eg:\n",
    "score = 85\n",
    "if score >= 90:\n",
    "    print(\"Grade: A\")\n",
    "elif score >= 80:\n",
    "    print(\"Grade: B\")\n",
    "elif score >= 70:\n",
    "    print(\"Grade: C\")\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    print(\"Grade: D or lower\")\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "iii. else Statement: Executes a block of code if none of the previous conditions are true.\n",
    "age = 16\n",
    "if age >= 18:\n",
    "    print(\"You are an adult.\")\n",
